# Cyclist - Google DA Certificate Case Study
## Ask
The question is: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
## Prepare
The dataset I used due to limitation of memory: 2024-01
## Process
### Step 1:factor exploration
- Rider_id: identical so removed
- ride_type: catogorical data type/ can be used to calculate the percentage of users in each group
- started_at/ended_at:Time frame data type: can be used to calculate the riding duration and day of week, hour of day of riding, after calculating duration, ended_at dimension can be deleted.
- start_station_name/start_station_id/end_station_name/end_station_id: categorial data type/ there are a lot of places to start with and end with. I don't include the demographic analysis in this report so removed the fatcors.
- start_lat/start_lng/end_lat/end_lng:start and end latitude and longitude. Can be used to calcuate the displacement rid using distance formulae. After that, the four dimensions can be removed.
- member_casual: categorical data/only has two catogories: member/casual
### Step 2: remove and create factors
- Rider_id removed
- Duration: ended_at - started_at -> format as seconds
- ended_at removed
- start_station_name	start_station_id	end_station_name	end_station_id removed
- Length = $`\sqrt{(startLat-endLat)^2+(startLng-endLng)^2}*111111`$ ([one degree of movement in longtitude or latitude is equal to 111111 meters](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/5821/calculating-latitude-longitude-x-miles-from-point#:~:text=The%20northwards%20displacement%20is%20r,(latitude)%20%2F%20111111%20degrees.))
- start_lat	start_lng	end_lat	end_lng removed
  dayofweek/ hourofday: extract weekday number and hour from start_at to analysis further -> start_at removed.
### Step 3 check if data is complete
- there is no missing value
- data in each column are consistent
### Step 4 check the validity of data
- the member_casual/ride_type are fine
- Duration: there are duration longer than 24 hours, 21 rows, can use formulae to make the duration valid but I will exclude this case since 21/144874 is too little.
- distance: there are zero distance which is meaningless data in this report, so exclude 6236 rows.
- Duration continued: there are zero duration records after removing zero distance records, so remove 18 rows.
- Bicycle speed: classic bicycle maximum speed is normally [8.5 m/s with down a gentle 5% slope](https://road-bike.co.uk/articles/average-speed.php#:~:text=Average%20speed%20-%20indications&text=Beginner%2C%20short%20distance%20(say%2010,)%3A%20average%20around%2016-19) and eletric bicycle maximum speed is normally [12.51m/s](https://www.gazellebikes.com/en-us/how-fast-do-electric-bikes-go#:~:text=Pedal%20assist%20motor&text=Most%20ebikes%20stop%20providing%20electric,into%20the%20current%20classification%20system.) Hence I exclude records exceed the limit in each category. 617 rows excluded.
## Analysis
Discovering each factor's relationship with member_casual:
Total 137985 records, 115346 members, 22638 casuals. This is an imbalance data but we are not predicting anything in this report, so ignore this issue.
### Rider_Type
Type_Distribution(%)  | Electric | Classic
------------- | ------------- | -------------
Casual  | 58.34  |  41.65
Member  | 45  |  55

From the table we can see that casual riders prefer electric bikes whereas member riders like classic bikes more. This could be caused by singe trip fee difference bettween classic and electric.
### Duration Type
Duration Type(%)  | Less than Half Hour | 0.5 - 1 hour | 1 - 2 hours | More than 2 hours
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
Casual  | 94.57  |  3.77 | 0.96 | 0.71
Member  | 96.65  |  2.73 | 0.25 | 0.37

From the table we can see both of the majority users are riding less than half hour. Hence let's take a closer look at the half hour distribution:

Casual             |  Member
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![](Casual_Duration_Distribution.png)  |  ![](Member_Duration_Distribution.png)

From the chats, we can conclude that they are similai in distribution of duration withitn one hour.

### Distance 

Casual             |  Member
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![](Casual_Distance_Pie_Chart.png)  |  ![](Member_Distance_Chart.png)

From the two charts we can see they both have the greatest amount of user in the group of riding 1000 - 2000 meters.

From the bar chart, we can see the distribution of distance riding is quite similar between causal and member riders. 
Member riders are riding averagely 2052 meters which is more than casual riders 1890 meters.

### Time

The last part is the time compponent. We compare day of week and hour of day in this report.

The chart indicates that causal riders enjoy riding on Monday and weekends more than member riders. On the other hand, member riders enjoy more on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.

This chart reveals that member riders are more active in the morning before 10am and 4-6pm than casual riders.

## Share

### Tool used in the report
This report uses only excel as a tool to visualize data. The limitaion of size of the datasets restricted the total number of data included in the report. Hence we can't explore different records under a same rider id in this report. I tried to import the 202401 dataset into mysql to increase the speed of cleaning data, however importing takes longer than I expected so I just use excel to clean data. 

### Visualization
This report contains tables, pie charts and bar charts to show the difference between casual and member riders across all factors except location factor.

## Act

### Intention of the report

The stakeholders of the bicycle company want to attract more people becoming their members, hence the business task is to make actions to turn casual riders to member riders. We discover some key differences between casual riders and member riders in this report in the aspect of ride type, duration of riding and time distributions.

### Action Suggestions

- Ride type: More electric bikes in market.
- Durationï¼šMost of the casual users riding less than half an hour, hence promotion vouchers can be given for new users riding less than half an hour.
- Distance: Prices should be different at difference level of riding like tax. 1000-2000m level's price can be lowered.
- Time: Monday and weekend prices can be lower to attract more casual users. More promotion vouchers can be given when casual riders are more active.
